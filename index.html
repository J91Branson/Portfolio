                <p>I got into coding to get in to a career I could enjoy and excel at; I started off learning some on my own and then found a Code Camp at SMU. I enjoyed coding right away, as I got further involved I met the struggles and frustrations like all coders. I pushed through the challenges I faced and found that while frustrating everytime I figured out a tough problem my skills became better. After learning more and more I enjoy coding a little more each day; and look forward to a rewarding career.</p>
                <p>The thing that helps me in this field is my previous experience in the security field; it has made me more able to handle stressful situations and push through long hours of work. I think the other thing I get from this experience is the ability to interact with other people and teach people. I was a field training officer and then an assistant manager; so I understand teaching people and can be a good leader.</p>
                <p>I guess the approach I take to work is to be laid back and productive; work should be fun and still a productive enviroment. Humor can make a great de-stresser and the more co-workers get along the more productive the team is.
                    Other than that I'm just your basic nerd; fitting the coding sterotype. </p>
